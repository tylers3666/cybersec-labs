# cybersec-labs
This repository documents my journey in cybersecurity, including TryHackMe writeups, custom scripts, and notes.

## How this repo is organized
- `tryhackme/` — Writeups for rooms and paths.
- `tools/` — Notes and custom scripts for security tools.

## Notes
- I redact real IPs/credentials and remove exploit payloads before publishing.
- For reproducibility I include sanitized steps and high-level methodology only.

## Current Progress
- Completed TryHackMe Pre-Security
- Completed TryHackMe Cyber Security 101
- Working on TryHackMe Jr Penetration Tester
