# cybersec-labs
This repository documents my journey in cybersecurity, including lab/challenge writeups, course progress, and notes.

## How this repo is organized
- `templates/` - Templates used to write reports.
- `writeups/` - Writeups for THM challenge rooms, HTB boxes, etc.
- `learning/` - Learning paths, courses, and certificates.

## Notes
- I redact real IPs/credentials and remove exploit payloads before publishing.
- For reproducibility I include sanitized steps and high-level methodology only.

## Current Progress
