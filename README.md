# cybersec-labs
Personal writeups of CTFs, TryHackMe, HackTheBox and home-lab engagements.

## How this repo is organized
- `writeups/` — each file is a single writeup (date + title).
- `templates/` — writeup + report templates.

## Notes
- I redact real IPs/credentials and remove exploit payloads before publishing.
- For reproducibility I include sanitized steps and high-level methodology only.

## Pinned
